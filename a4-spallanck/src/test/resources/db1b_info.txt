The DB1BParser parses a CSV file from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics'
Origin and Destination Survey dataset, available from the BTS website:

    https://transtats.bts.gov/Tables.asp?DB_ID=125

Download a csv file from the DB1BCoupon dataset, extract it in this directory,
and run your ShortestPaths program with the db1b fileType and the csv filename.
The dataset is large, so it may take a few seconds to run Dijkstra on the whole
graph!
